# APKUpdater OSS

*[🇷🇺 Читать на русском](README.md)*

**APKUpdater OSS** is an open-source tool that simplifies the process of finding updates for your installed apps. It provides functionality similar to an app store but aggregates updates across multiple independent sources.

This project is a heavily modified and modernized fork of the original [APKUpdater](https://github.com/rumboalla/apkupdater) created by [rumboalla](https://github.com/rumboalla). Huge thanks to the original author for the brilliant foundation!
